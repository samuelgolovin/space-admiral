# Planet Hopper Prototype Roadmap Checklist (Solo Developer)

This checklist outlines the development phases for building the Planet Hopper prototype as a solo developer.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Core Mechanics
- [x] Set up project folder and version control (e.g., GitHub)
- [x] Create full-screen canvas and responsive layout
- [ ] Implement gravity-based physics for planets and rockets
- [x] Add click-drag launch mechanic with velocity preview
- [x] Simulate orbit prediction with dashed lines
- [ ] Add multiple planets with mass-based gravity

---

## 🌍 Phase 2: Planet Interaction
- [ ] Detect landings and crashes
- [ ] Assign planet types (neutral, trade, hostile)
- [ ] Allow claiming or conquering planets
- [ ] Add basic resource generation from owned planets

---

## ⚖️ Phase 3: Trade vs. Conquest System
- [ ] Define ship stats (cargo, weapons, mobility)
- [ ] Implement trade mechanics (cargo, market prices)
- [ ] Implement conquest mechanics (weapons, AI enemies)
- [ ] Add consequences (e.g., conquest hurts diplomacy)

---

## 🌳 Phase 4: Tech Tree & Progression
- [ ] Design a dual-path tech tree (Trade vs. Conquest)
- [ ] Implement tech tree data structure
- [ ] Create a toggleable UI panel for the tech tree
- [ ] Allow unlocking techs and triggering effects
- [ ] Tie tech unlocks to in-game currency or XP

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: UI, Feedback & Polish
- [ ] Add UI for resources, fuel, and ship stats
- [ ] Add buttons: launch, reset, toggle tech tree
- [ ] Add basic sound effects and background music
- [ ] Add animations for launching and landing

---

## 🧠 Phase 6: Playtesting & Iteration
- [ ] Playtest the prototype yourself
- [ ] Ask friends or online communities to try it
- [ ] Fix bugs and balance trade vs. conquest
- [ ] Polish visuals and UX

---

## 🏁 Phase 7: Endgame & Expansion (Optional)
- [ ] Add hostile AI or monsters
- [ ] Add diplomacy and alliances
- [ ] Add endgame goals (e.g., unify galaxy, build megastructure)
- [ ] Add save/load system
